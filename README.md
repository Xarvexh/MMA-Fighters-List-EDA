This repository contains a dataset of mma fighters and their details such as height, weight, striking accuracy, etc, downloaded from kaggle.
And the other file is a jupyter notebook file where all the data cleaning, integration, transformation and EDA process has been applied to it. 
With time being, machine leanring algorithms will also be applied to predict the win/lose percentage based on their abilities.
